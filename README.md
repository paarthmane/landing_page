# landing_page
this websites tell you about the cars that i like 

Problems I faced creating this website 
1.all the images inside this website had direct link to their original websites 
2. didn't knew how to host website on github
3. rather than adding index.html file directly to the repo ,I created new folder and added the html file and css file 


This website is not responsive at all
